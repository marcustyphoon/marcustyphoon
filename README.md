Hi! I'm Marcus. This is my to-do list, mostly for New XKit. It seemed like a reasonable place to put it.

Tag Tracking+

- [x] make tag tracking+ svg not a background and color it

Anti-Capitalism

- [x] test and undraft anti-capitalism changes

- Once implemented, use xkit.interface.hide

Show Originals

- [ ] maybe add "show all posts sourced from blogs I follow" to show-originals beta and get poked by all the devs with sticks because feature creep is bad
- [ ] make the show originals beta use dropdowns in settings
- [ ] use --post-padding for shrinking indicators

- [ ] fix broken interaction between no-recommended and show-originals

- Once implemented, use xkit.interface.hide

No Recommended

- [ ] converge the no-recommended and my show-originals indicators
- [ ] maybe make an a/b/c option for the devs of old/shrunk/"shrunk and it indicates who the post is from and has a 'show' button"
- [ ] use --post-padding for shrinking indicators

- Once implemented, use xkit.interface.hide

Hide "where were we"

- [ ] test my "hide where were we" code by making it transparent or something
- [ ] publish my "hide where were we" code as a draft (??)

Other

- [x] ask about tweaks settings cleanup, and settings for non-working-on-new-dash features in general
- [x] ~~ask about and/or~~ publish cssmap tools *as a Gist*

- [ ] potentially look at "shorten posts"

Not XKit related

- [ ] maybe make that markdeep conversion script
- [ ] solve global inequality and injustice
