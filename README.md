Hi! I'm Marcus. This is my to-do list, mostly for New XKit. It seemed like a reasonable place to put it.

Everything with a sidebar

- [x] just for fun, try my hand at updating XKit.interface.sidebar, ~~haha, this will go poorly~~
- [ ] wow that actually worked. okay, refine the css significantly
- [ ] find out where the css actually goes
- [ ] possibly refactor everything from hacky css to construct_react changes

Tag Tracking+

- [x] make tag tracking+ svg not a background and color it

Anti-Capitalism

- [x] test anti-capitalism changes
- [ ] undraft the PR with xkit.interface.hide when it comes out

No Recommended

- [x] implement full hide toggle
- [x] converge the no-recommended and my show-originals indicators
- [x] maybe make an a/b/c option for the devs of old/shrunk/"shrunk and it indicates who the post is from and has a 'show' button"
- [x] use css from show originals to fix peepr
- [x] PR it
- [ ] undraft the PR with xkit.interface.hide when it comes out

Show Originals

- [x] ~~make the show originals beta use dropdowns in settings~~ nevermind probably; too hard to describe the options well
- [x] ~~maybe add "show all posts sourced from blogs I follow" to show-originals beta and get poked by all the devs with sticks because feature creep is bad~~ decided not to; probably too performance intensive
- [ ] fix interaction between no-recommended and show-originals (and blacklist and etc etc)
- [ ] add back the sidebar button
- [ ] add back the legacy code (possibly rebuilding the extension)
- [ ] undraft the PR with xkit.interface.hide when it comes out
- [ ] maybe look into radio buttons
- [ ] maybe add excluded blogs

Hide "where were we"

- [ ] test my "hide where were we" code by making it transparent or something
- [ ] publish my "hide where were we" code as a draft (??)

Other

- [x] ask about tweaks settings cleanup, and settings for non-working-on-new-dash features in general
- [x] ~~ask about and/or~~ publish cssmap tools *as a Gist*
- [ ] potentially look at "shorten posts"

Not XKit related

- [ ] maybe make that markdeep conversion script
- [ ] solve global inequality and injustice
