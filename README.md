Hi! I'm Marcus. This is my to-do list. It seemed like a reasonable place to put it.

- [ ] make tag tracking+ svg not a background and color it

- [ ] converge the no-recommended and my show-originals indicators
- [ ] maybe make an a/b/c option for the devs of old/shrunk/"shrunk and it indicates who the post is from and has a 'show' button"
- [ ] fix broken interaction between no-recommended and show-originals
- [ ] test my "hide where were we" code by making it transparent or something

- [ ] ask about tweaks settings cleanup, and settings for non-working-on-new-dash features in general

- [ ] ask about and/or publish cssmap tools

- [ ] maybe add "show all posts sourced from blogs I follow" to show-originals beta and get poked by all the devs with sticks because feature creep is bad
- [ ] make the show originals beta use dropdowns in settings

- [ ] maybe make that markdeep conversion script
